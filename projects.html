				<h1>My projects</h1>
				<p>This is a random collection of projects I've worked on accross the years. Most of them are works in progress (and probably will be foreverâ€¦), having a full time job I can't dedicate as much time as I would like to them.</p>
			<p>I use most my projects as learning platforms, and strive when possible to write all the code myself with minimal dependencies.</p>

					<h3>Simple rss reader</h3>
					<p>This a really simple and basic rss reader, it doesn't have all the fancy features of some readers, but it was build for me by me and does everything I want it to do. </p>
					<p>I built it in Go, with the objective of having as little depencies as possible, and minimal javascript</p>

					<h3>Velib near me</h3>
					<p>The velib app was too slow to be used out and about on my Fairphone 3, I needed something that I could use on the go to find Velib stations near me as well as the number of free docks / bikes.</p>
					<p> Thankfully there's an open API just for that, and this super simple app was born.</p>

					<h3>Wordle with information theory</h3>
					<p>I studied signal processing, and play wordle, this seemed like the most obvious solution.</p>
					<p>I get beaten by my bot most daysâ€¦</p>
